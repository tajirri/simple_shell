+ This ALX project creates a shell program in C that:

	- Develop a basic shell that displays a prompt and waits for user input.
        - Execute simple commands without arguments.
        - Handle errors, such as command not found and end-of-file conditions.
	- Expand the shell to handle commands with arguments.
        - Improve the shell to manage the system's PATH.
        - Avoid unnecessary fork calls if the command doesn't exist.
        - Implement the exit command to gracefully exit the shell.
        - Add env command to display the current environment.
        - Create custom getline function without using getline.
        - Eliminate use of strtok in the code.
        - Enhance  exit command to handle exit status.
        - Introduce setenv and unsetenv commands for environment variable management.
